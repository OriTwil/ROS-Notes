# ROS-Notes
ROS Learning Materials，Click [here](https://github.com/OriTwil/ROS-Notes/blob/master/%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E.md) for the Chinese version of the instructions.

## Description
- Prior knowledge required before learning ROS: CPP Linux basics (basic commands and knowledge).
- Install dual boot, do not use virtual machines. However, students without experience are advised to seek help from experienced students. Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 is recommended, as ROS2 can only be used in 22.04, and we will only be using ROS1 for now.
- Some small experiments and deadlines will be set later.
- ROS is just a "tool", and the key to learning is to complete the experiments. You will quickly get the hang of it.

## Recommended Resources
- [Tutorial 1](https://wiki.ros.org/Documentation): The wiki is the most comprehensive tutorial. Most of the problems encountered while learning ROS can be found on the Wiki. There is also a Chinese translation available.
- [Tutorial 2](http://www.autolabor.com.cn/book/ROSTutorials/): A very efficient Chinese tutorial with detailed videos (on Bilibili) and code. It is recommended to follow the tutorial and watch the videos when you don't understand something.
- [zhangrelay](https://blog.csdn.net/ZhangRelay), Fish Fragrant ROS, and Ancient Moon House: High-quality blogs.
- Reference book: Download it directly from the reference-book folder in this repository.
